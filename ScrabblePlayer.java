  Description of the overall algorithm and key data structures:
      The dictionary is stored as a trie.
          Each entry in the trie has a byte element, representing its index in the alphabet
          Each entry has a size 26 array of children
      To find the best Scrabble Word
          Find the word on the board, return as original word
          Find words the start with one of the letters from original word
          Find words that are the original word + a suffix
          Return the word that is worth the most points
      Finding words (availableCharacters, currentEntry, currentResult)
          if current entry is the end of a word
              check to see if its more points than the currentResult
              if it is, currentResult = entry -> scrabble word
          For each available character c, convert c to it's index in the alphabet array
              This uses hashing to make this constant time
              find the entry next at the same index in currentEntry.children
              Remove c from availableCharacters
              if next entry is the end of a word
                  check to see if its more points than the currentResult
                  if it is, currentResult = entry -> scrabble word
              recurse using nextEntry, the new availableCharacters, and the current best result
          return the best result
              
   To find a next best word selection from the dictionary for the Scrabble.
   The program mostly uses hash, binary representation (byte), and trie algorithm
